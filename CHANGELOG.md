## [Unreleased]

### Fixed — AttackMap#253

- **Repo walking now uses `attackmap.sdk.fs`.** `detect()` and `analyze()` walk with `iter_repo_files` and read with `read_source`. Skip dirs are matched by repo-relative name and pruned, so a repo checked out under a `vendor/` directory is analyzed instead of yielding no PHP files.
- **Symlinked files pointing outside the repo are not analyzed**, unreadable files no longer raise out of `analyze()`, and cp1252/latin-1 PHP sources are decoded instead of silently dropped. AttackMap's own report directories are skipped.
- `detect()`'s `module.config.php` probe stops at the first match and no longer looks inside `vendor/` (a vendored `laminas-mvc` alone no longer makes a repo look like a Laminas app).

### Changed

- **Priority 30 → 70** (AttackMap#221). Core now runs analyzers in `(priority, name)` order and merges first-seen-wins, so this framework-specific analyzer runs after the generic `php-web` analyzer (40). Still experimental and opt-in: `attackmap analyze <repo> -m php-laminas`.
- Skip list is now the SDK's `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS` (was `vendor`, `.git`, `node_modules`; adds `build`, `dist`, `out`, `target`, virtualenvs and caches).
- Signal `file` paths are always POSIX-style, including on Windows.
- Requires an AttackMap core that ships `attackmap.sdk.fs`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Initial public release. Framework-aware Laminas analyzer plugin for AttackMap
- Registered under the `attackmap.analyzers` entry-point group so the core
  AttackMap CLI auto-discovers this analyzer once installed.
- Emits Signal-v2 records (`file:line` citation, evidence text, and confidence
  score) for every signal.
